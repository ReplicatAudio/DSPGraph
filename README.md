## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`).

Start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of DSPGraph:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
